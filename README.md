# Cognitive constraints on number and case morpheme orders: experimental code and data sets

This repository contains all the materials needed to run the experiments and analyses reported in in Saldana, Yohei & Culbertson (submitted) ''Cross-linguistic patterns of morpheme order reflect cognitive biases: An experimental study of case and number morphology''.

##Running the experiments

This repository contains all the materials needed to run the reported experiment using the ``PsychoPy2`` standalone (python 2.7). The versions of the code provided are set to to run on a 13” screen as well as on a 27”. [Caveats: If you are running the code on the terminal instead, make sure you have PsychoPy installed as well as all the other required packages specified in the header of the two .py files contained in this folder.]

Create a U39Lab folder on your desktop and add the two .py scripts within the
